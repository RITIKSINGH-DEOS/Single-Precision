# SPR Representation

This project is a web-based application designed to visualize the IEEE 754 single-precision floating-point representation of decimal numbers. It includes smooth animations powered by GSAP to enhance the user experience.

## Features

- Converts decimal numbers to IEEE 754 single-precision format.
- Displays sign, exponent, and mantissa components separately.
- Smooth animations powered by GSAP.
- Interactive and visually appealing interface.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**
- **CSS**
- **JavaScript**
- **GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform)**

## How to Use

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/RITIKSINGH-DEOS/SPR-REPRESENTATION.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**:
   ```bash
   cd SPR-REPRESENTATION
   ```

3. **Open the `index.html` File**:
   Open the `index.html` file in your preferred web browser to view the application.

4. **Convert a Number**:
   - Enter a decimal number in the input field.
   - Click the "Convert" button to see its IEEE 754 single-precision representation.
